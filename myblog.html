    <h1>Road to become a free man</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I am Simone and today (17.11.2025) is my first day when i am writing this blog. I have been thinking for long time whether i should start this blog or not. Inspired by Cosmin (my best friend) and another hackcluber i decided to write this blog.</p>
    <p>I am not living the life I want and that s bc i have to do stuff that i dont want to do, things others want for me (like homework, going to school, listening to boring people). I want way more from my life, i want to experience the real world. In my believes i think that is way more important to have a flexible life then to have money (for example to go ping pong on a random Tuesday morning).</p>
    <p>The only way to escape this matrix is to make money, so i can sustain my lifestyle without depending on others.</p>
    <p>So my goal for now is to money that can sustain my life. My biggest goal is to make something can impact others life, also this is another reason why i write this blog, i want to leave something behind me</p>
    <p>I know that i can do this only if i work hard and stay focused on my goals. I will try to post on this block every challenge i have on my road. Enjoy! (also the lack of css is intentional)</p>

    <h2>My first project</h2>
    <p>I have been trading sp500 index for some time now, and i think that this is a good way to make some money. So the first project it is a sp500 trader bot in python. i have already made it but  it has a problem, it doesnt send you the email and also it isnt on a server, so these are the things that we are going to solve today (17.11.2025)- <a href="https://github.com/zyreoo/sp500bot">Github</a> </p>
