    <h1>Road to become a free person</h1>
    <p>Hi there! I am Simone and today (17.11.2025) is my first day when i am writing this blog. I have been thinking for long time whether i should start this blog or not. Inspired by Cosmin (my best friend) and another hackcluber i decided to write this blog.</p>
    <p>I am not living the life I want and that s bc i have to do stuff that i dont want to do, things others want for me (like homework, going to school, listening to boring people). I want way more from my life, i want to experience the real world. In my believes i think that is way more important to have a flexible life then to have money (for example to go ping pong on a random Tuesday morning).</p>
    <p>The only way to escape this matrix is to make money, so i can sustain my lifestyle without depending on others.</p>
    <p>So my goal for now is to money that can sustain my life. My biggest goal is to make something can impact others life, also this is another reason why i write this blog, i want to leave something behind me</p>
    <p>I know that i can do this only if i work hard and stay focused on my goals. I will try to post on this block every challenge i have on my road. Enjoy! (also the lack of css is intentional)</p>

    <p>Press space for a song that matches my vibe!!!!</p>
    <h2>My first project</h2>
    <p>I have been trading sp500 index for some time now, and i think that this is a good way to make some money. So the first project it is a sp500 trader bot in python. i have already made it but  it has a problem, it doesnt send you the email and also it isnt on a server, so these are the things that we are going to solve today (17.11.2025)- <a href="https://github.com/zyreoo/sp500bot">Github</a> </p>
    <p>Email sender solved, i have to find a free server:), or i should buy a home server? idk? bc i need it for more stuff than only small projects</p>
    <p><s>Dream</s> Next features:</p>
    <li>Price prediction based on some indicators</li>
    <li>To use openai api</li>
    <li>To make trades automatically</li>

    <h2>My second project</h2>
    <p>My family has log cabins and a hotel in Beclean (24km from Dej), so i have been involved in marketing and related activities. And the best way is to put ur buildings on website (local/global) and then to make social media things. So my idea was to build a website with an ai agent into, that can help you to find ur dream place:). I have build a version of it in Neighborhood (a HackClub project in San Francisco), but it has so many bugs and things that i dont like.</p>
    <p>So the next things for today (18.11.2025) are:</p>
    <li>To navigate all the website and see where are all the bugs and also see what we dont like</li>
    <li>To make a list with all the bugs and things that we dont like</li>

    <p>Next stuff:</p>
    <li>To start solving the list</li>
